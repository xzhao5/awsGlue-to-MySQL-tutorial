# Implementation Plan: How to load data from MySQL RDS to S3 using AWS Database Migration Servers (DMS) 2 - achieve CDC in DMS

> In previous [tutorial](https://github.com/xzhao5/awsGlue-to-MySQL-tutorial/blob/361ad204940c12e227b3726854767040a7dfd9b7/mysql-to-s3-ingestion.md), A bridge linking MySQL RDS databases and S3 has been established successfully. However, a job runs daily to transfer data from the database to S3, and there is a concern about how to incorporate changes if a user inserts or updates new information. To address this issue, the option of enabling CDC on DMS is being considered.
> 
## Prerequisiteï¼š
### 1. A AWS working account.
### 2. A IAM role which can access s3 and rds.
### 3. A S3 bucket created for this task.
### 4. A RDS database with full data.

## Please refer last [tutorial](https://github.com/xzhao5/awsGlue-to-MySQL-tutorial/blob/361ad204940c12e227b3726854767040a7dfd9b7/mysql-to-s3-ingestion.mdstep) 1 to step 3 as same steps.  
## Step 4: Create a new migration job - Full load and ongoing replicaiton
#### 4.1 select your replication instance created in last tutorial:

> INSERT INTO p3project.DepartmentsTest(department_id,department, collect_year,collect_month,collect_day) VALUES (25, 'other5',year(current_timestamp()), month(current_timestamp()),day(current_timestamp()));
> INSERT INTO p3project.DepartmentsTest(department_id,department, collect_year,collect_month,collect_day) VALUES (24, 'other4',year(current_timestamp()), month(current_timestamp()),day(current_timestamp()));
> commit;

#### 1.2 select 'AWS service' -> 'DMS' -> Click 'Next':

GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* to admin@'%';
