# Implementation Plan: How to load data from MySQL RDS to S3 using AWS Database Migration Servers (DMS) 2 - achieve CDC in DMS

> In previous [tutorial](https://github.com/xzhao5/awsGlue-to-MySQL-tutorial/blob/361ad204940c12e227b3726854767040a7dfd9b7/mysql-to-s3-ingestion.md), A bridge linking MySQL RDS databases and S3 has been established successfully. However, a job runs daily to transfer data from the database to S3, and there is a concern about how to incorporate changes if a user inserts or updates new information. To address this issue, the option of enabling CDC on DMS is being considered.
