> Why we need to import CSV files into MySQL? 
> This is because some CSV files are too big, for example, 'order_product' and 'orders' and it doesn't make sense to create large amount of SQL insert statements to insert data into the tables (Think about your time and system resource). 

## Step 1: Insert small size csv files by using insert commands.
